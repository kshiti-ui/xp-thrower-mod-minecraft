# Use on public servers
I DO NOT support the use of this mod on any public servers which do not allow this kind of mod. The mod does work on servers but I do not approve of, and will not, support anyone that attempts to use this mod on servers.

If you wish to use this mod on private servers then that's on you. If you use this on public servers and are banned (**specially in tier testing servers**) then that's on you and I will not support your use of this mod in that way.
